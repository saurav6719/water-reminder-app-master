## Experience

When I started this project, I had no idea how complex building a storefront could be. But step by step, I figured it out.

I designed and built everything from scratch‚Äîstructuring data, styling components, making sure everything loads fast. I used [GraphQL Zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus) to talk to [Shopify‚Äôs GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront), [Shopify Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen-react) to power the storefront, and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for performance.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) made styling smooth. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) kept everything safe and predictable. [React Use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) Hooks sped up development. I even built [Shopify Utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maxvien/shopify) to make selecting product variants easier.

Then came [SEO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo), best practices, and refining the user experience. [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) made touch interactions feel natural. [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) kept the code clean.

It was a process of learning, breaking things, fixing them, and refining. And in the end, it wasn‚Äôt just about building a store‚Äîit was about building something that works beautifully.
